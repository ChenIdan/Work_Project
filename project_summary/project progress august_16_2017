We have encounterd problems with division by zero. because we get the dependent probability matrix of markov order k by dividing the probabilities vectors
of the joint probabilities of all possible sequences of matkov order mk and mk-1, and probability zero is encounterd in those vectors, which creats 
a runtime error.

souloution: we need to add some values to normalize the probability matrix in such way that the original probability values will be saved,
but the zeroes will disapear and replaced by positive values.
